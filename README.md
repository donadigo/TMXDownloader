# TMXDownloader
## Massively download replays from the TMX database

This is an extension for Chrome that was used to automatically download
replays from the current TMX page for [TMTrackNN](https://github.com/donadigo/TMTrackNN). At the moment it only works in Chrome and doesn't have any bells and whistles. Adds a small "Download All" button at the bottom of every TMX result page.
